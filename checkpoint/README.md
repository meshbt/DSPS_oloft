# Checkpoints
If versions of packages are the same and the seeds set in OLOFT.ipynb are kept the results should be exactly replicated. However the contents of this folder for our trained models can be downloaded as a zip file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1onLzn1LgTW80V_KX6AEgWY4J7blnWzho/view?usp=sharing). Extract these files here.


You can also automatically do all of this using the `OLOFT_checkpoints.ipynb` notebook.
